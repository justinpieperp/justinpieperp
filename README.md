### Hi there 👋

I'm Justin Pieper...p. The last p is for nothing only because that username Justin Pieper has been taken. <br>
I start a new life every day.<br>
I feel so grateful that I have the best parents and grandparents in my world("best" is meaning only to me, I believe everyone has their own best families!).<br>
My biggest wish is their health and happiness.<br>
I love this world &&

<b>It's never too late to start.</b>

"别再继续等待 一直观望徘徊 <br>
把征途中的星辰大海全都浪费在接受命运的安排" <br>
